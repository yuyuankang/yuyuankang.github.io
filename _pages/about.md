<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


My name is Yuyuan Kang. I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests lie broadly in the area of Computer Systems and Data Management, including building efficient and scalable systems for data processing and analytics. I am currently working with Prof. [Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/).

Before that, I obtained my Master's Degree in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University, where I was supervised by Prof. [Jianmin Wang](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/jianminwang.htm) and worked closely with Prof [Shaoxu Song](https://sxsong.github.io/) and Xiangdong Huang. I did my undergraduate at Northeastern University (China).
